2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_clk_ref and rgmii_rxc are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_clk_ref] -to [get_clocks rgmii_rxc]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out2_clk_ref and rgmii_rxc are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out2_clk_ref] -to [get_clocks rgmii_rxc]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.171 ns between u1/smi_config_inst/link_reg/C (clocked by clk_out2_clk_ref) and u1/arbi_inst/link_d0_reg/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.685 ns between u1/smi_config_inst/speed_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out2_clk_ref) and u1/arbi_inst/speed_d0_reg[0]/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rgmii_rxctl relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rgmii_rxd[0] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rgmii_rxd[1] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rgmii_rxd[2] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rgmii_rxd[3] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst_n relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc, sys_clk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on e_reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk_p
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txc relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txctl relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txd[0] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txd[1] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txd[2] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txd[3] relative to clock(s) rgmii_rxc
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u1/smi_config_inst/smi_inst/mdio_en_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u1/smi_config_inst/smi_inst/mdio_en_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 5.000 [get_ports sys_clk_p] (Source: D:/demo_AX7204/19 ethernet_test_1g_100m/rgmii_ethernet/eth_test.srcs/constrs_1/new/top.xdc (Line: 6))

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 5.000 [get_ports sys_clk_p] (Source: D:/demo_AX7204/19 ethernet_test_1g_100m/rgmii_ethernet/eth_test.srcs/constrs_1/new/top.xdc (Line: 6))
